<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Simple - you are not a great engineer if you unable to share your knowledge , remember 99% people will be forgotten once they gone. So i plan to put my simple research and maybe will be archive in north atlantic later under github archive project lol ! Maybe next generation will see my code haha


Here's why:
* You only  life once  (yolo !!)
* Great engineer at least do something out side their work (come on work whole year never comeout with anything to share? really ?)
* Great engineer at least have some proff that not only can "talk" but also have going through the pain and blood altogether
* Great engineer always willing to share/discuss with people from other industry
* At least with this all those university/newbie/experience/IT enthusiast can pick something 



Of course, no one care and sometime nobody care - even in Industry world- "when someone in meeting say I dont care" some engineer feel ..... (you can feel it) (lol kidding !)

So same like this - we dont care whether you read, use or whatever, my concern is just to ensure at least somebody in this world
can learn and utilize it for greater purpose.
